        <h2 class="section-two__title">About Me</h2>
    
       <p class="section-three__desc"> Passion drives my journey in web development. Armed with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and an MBA in
        System Management, I pursued my passion further with an MSc in Cybersecurity from the esteemed Edge Hill
        University in the UK. As a woman in the dynamic world of IT, I am on a relentless quest to explore the uncharted
        territories of technology.

        Every day is an opportunity to discover something new, and I thrive on the excitement of brimming with fresh
        ideas. The process of creating something from scratch and witnessing it come to life on my screen is a truly
        extraordinary experience.
        I also have a unique connection with the world of media, having spent time in Tamil News Media. My passion for
        news presentation has always been cherished in my mind.

        My love for web development is not just a profession; it's a calling. I'm here to make the digital world a
        better place, one code at a time.

        Join me on this exhilarating journey of innovation and growth. Let's build something amazing together.</p>
